Ideally, outputs are always displayed in the standard output, which by default is the terminal.

This can be redirected to the a file instead

To do that, we use the `>` operator to write a specified file.

While `>>` is used to append a new line to a file, `>` is used to overwrite the file.


Also, we use `<` to set input redirections

Here document is used to redirect input into an interactive shell script or program.

It follows the following syntax:
`command << delimiter
  document
delimiter`
